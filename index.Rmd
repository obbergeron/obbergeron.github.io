I am currently a Research Associate at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business. I hold an M.A. and B.A. in Political Science from McGill University in Montreal (2018). I'm interested in political behavior and political economy, with methodological interests in causal inference, survey research, and metascience. My recent research focuses on citizens' attitudes toward democracy; expert forecasting; information consumption and social media; and political polarization.
